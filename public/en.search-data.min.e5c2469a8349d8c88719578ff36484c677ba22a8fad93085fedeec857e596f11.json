[{"id":0,"href":"/posts/init/","title":"Init","section":"Posts","content":"Hello all,\nLike computer systems, we also have the first process or the first step, of course I too have one. This blog is about how I got intrigued with technology. The first thing that excited me was Google\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;search bar\u0026rdquo;. Yeah, you heard it right. I spent a whole lot of time, typing in different words to see differences in search result. At that time, I was not even aware of keywords. Sometimes I type in different combination of words to check if it returns an expected result. But again the thing that hooked me up into this digital world, ended up being hated by millions, so unreal\u0026hellip; maybe thousands including me. The thing is Everything has it\u0026rsquo;s time to shine and for google, it\u0026rsquo;s not gone but also not the brightest. I clearly don\u0026rsquo;t know why I am writing this blog, but got excited about the idea of init, the first process, the first step of entering. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s seems to be a good idea only in my head, I just really need to validate my own thoughts before procedings. Anyway it is always a pleasant (not always) to look back (traces of the past).\nI just wanted this post to be my first post for some reason I don\u0026rsquo;t remember now, maybe this post can be added as an example for butterfly effect. Probably I wrote this post because, there is always going to be an inevitable change and things changes. It is actually a beautiful thing, that at one moment, you are not even aware of a certain thing\u0026rsquo;s existence, but once you learn or atleast encounter that thing, suddenly you become aware. I am beginning this blog with this post as a reminder, since the goal of this blog is to document moments of awareness like this and also, to explore about concepts and tools that are very much exciting.\nThank you for reading.\nPlease do share with your friends.\n\u0026lt;3 mads\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/about/","title":"About","section":"mads' hack","content":"Hello all,\nI am mads. I\u0026rsquo;m a tech enthusiast, well that\u0026rsquo;s a broader domain but particularly interested in building systems (programming), delving into linux, programming languages and networking concepts. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m learning Go (golang) and trying my best to build something that is useful. I may have a broader domain that I need to catch up to but my interest region is rather small, that includes open source tech community which excites me each and every time.\nI am here to document my tech journey (not about climbing the ladder or pathway kind of stuff). I always thought about technical writing and documenting the process of learning. And this blog is the answer to that thought, here I will be writing about tools and some other tech related stuffs (and some personal preferences) that I\u0026rsquo;m excited about and use on a regular basis.\nThank you\n"}]
