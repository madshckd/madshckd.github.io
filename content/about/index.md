Hello all,

I am mads. I'm a tech enthusiast, well that's a broader domain but particularly interested in building systems (programming), delving into linux, programming languages and networking concepts. For now, I'm learning Go ([golang](https://go.dev)) and trying my best to build something that is useful. I may have a broader domain that I need to catch up to but my interest region is rather small, that includes open source tech community which excites me each and every time.

I am here to document my tech journey (not about climbing the ladder or pathway kind of stuff). I always thought about technical writing and documenting the process of learning. And this blog is the answer to that thought, here I will be writing about tools and some other tech related stuffs (and some personal preferences) that I'm excited about and use on a regular basis.

Thank you
